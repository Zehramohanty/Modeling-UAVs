# Modeling and Optimization of UAV Swarm using the Genetic Algorithm 


In this project, the goal was to implement a machine learning/genetic algorithm model in order to determine the optimal control parameters for a drone simulation. The drone simulation is a swarm of autonomous vehicles (agents) whose task is to map a set of targets, avoid collisions with obstacles, and avoid collisions with each other in the quickest way. 

Tested using Python version 3.11.7.
